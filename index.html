    I recently <a href="https://google.com">realizeD</a> that every day comes with its opportunities, which if not being utilized judiciously, might lead to enormous regrets.
    This thought often resonate in my mind and it makes me intentional in all my endeavours. A times, people may encounter disappointments
    and frustration could easily set in when efforts taken to excel proved abortive. Unfortunately, this might consequently result into depression
    or other critical challenges.
